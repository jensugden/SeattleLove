Search Engine Optimization provides a business or individual with a means to promote their site via Google keyword search. SEO implementation requires a web developer to work closely with the marketing team or individuals who specialize in SEO. Knowing the basics of how SEO works is to a developers benefit. From the very beginning of designing and building a website, a developer should know how the structure and keywords will impact an SEO. Getting it right in the beginning will make SEO clean-up easier in the end.

Getting your website listed on a search engine response page is the goal for web developers. A page won't be useful if it can't be found. Targeting the website's client base is important and should be well thought out and planned by using the appropriate keyword research. Also avoiding pitfalls of SEO and knowing the no-no's of Google's SEO is key.

I would ideally implement Seattle Loves SEO to target locals and tourists. My current tabs show photos of Food, Hiking, and Attractions. Users I would target for Food would be those who are interested in current food trends, food culture, and food photography. Users who are interested in the outdoors, and who are local to the area, may be more interested in the Hiking tab. I would target key words that attract outdoor and active people who hike. Keywords, like trails, mountains, views, scenic, scenery, could work. And I would want to target tourists and locals to the Attractions tab.

In order to structure Seattle Loves into a better organized SEO searchable site, I would rework each page to have different search sections. Each new section would would have an h2 tag with a brief paragraph. Each of these sections would be a different aspect of the main tab (food, hiking, attractions). For example:

<h1>SEATTLE HIKING</h1>
  <p>Discover hikes that will wind through mountains and over rivers to the most scenic views. </p>
  //insert row of photos here

  <h2>Trails</h2>
  <p>Discover or rediscover trails that the locals love.</p>
   //insert row of photos here

  <h2>Mountains</h2>
  <p>Be an explorer and traverse those mountains.</p> //or some such text
  //insert row of photos here
  
Meta-tags that I would implement are:
Title: Seattle Loves Photos
Description: Seattle Loves is all about a love of Seattle. Find inspirational photos of Seattle for food lovers, outdoor enthusiasts, and thrill-seekers. Use all of that inspiration to plan your next Seattle outting!
