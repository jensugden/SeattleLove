Seattle Love website for people who love Seattle.

This web site will be an access point to free stock photos of Seattle. Photos are pulled in through the unsplash.com API. The API can be found here:https://unsplash.com/developers

The goal of this web site is to provide an easy way for users to look up photos of Seattle Food, Hiking, and Attractions, so they can be inspired and plan their next outing. Photos should link out to Unsplash.com and should have user/photographer information.
